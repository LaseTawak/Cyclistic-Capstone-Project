Data used focuses on the year 2020 and can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## Goal/Objective
Aim to uncover insights that aid in converting casual riders into annual members. This involves examining ride behaviors, station popularity, and time-based usage trends to devise effective strategies for membership growth.

## Analysis
The analysis meticulously evaluated Cyclistic's data, focusing on rider behavior differences. Key insights included identifying patterns of long trip preferences among casual riders and specific stations with high activity. Members displayed more regular usage patterns, highlighting potential target areas for promoting membership. Data gaps, particularly in bike location tracking, were noted, suggesting operational improvements. The analysis underscored the need for strategic actions like adjusting pricing models and tailoring promotions to convert casual riders into members.

## Results
The analysis revealed distinct patterns in bike usage. Casual riders, dominating long trips, preferred classic bikes and were particularly active on weekends. The study observed high foot traffic at specific stations, with Streeter Dr & Grand Ave being a hotspot for casual riders. Notably, casual riders often started and ended trips at the same stations, hinting at leisure-focused usage. In contrast, members showed more consistent riding patterns throughout the week. The data suggested operational improvements, like enhancing bike location tracking, and strategic actions, such as revising late return charges and offering promotions, to encourage casual riders to become members
